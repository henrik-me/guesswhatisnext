# CS25 — MSSQL E2E Testing (Expanded Scope)

**Status:** 🔄 In Progress
**Goal:** MSSQL as a supported local dev container with HTTPS, logging, telemetry (including OTel trace verification), cold-start simulation, and per-test server log correlation. Run the full E2E suite against the MSSQL + Caddy HTTPS stack and add coverage for HTTPS behavior, structured logging, OTel traces, and cold-start UX with real server delays.

**Deferred from:** [CS19 — Community Puzzle Navigation & Testing](done/done_cs19_community-puzzle-navigation.md) (task CS19-4)
**Reason deferred:** Docker MSSQL E2E testing requires additional infrastructure setup beyond the scope of the CS19 navigation changes. The MSSQL Docker stack (`docker-compose.mssql.yml`) was set up as part of CS18 but E2E test automation against it has not been implemented yet.

## Design Decisions

- **Scope:** E2E browser tests against MSSQL + HTTPS + logging + telemetry + cold start. Not unit-level adapter tests (those exist in `tests/mssql-adapter.test.js`).
- **Docker stack:** Uses existing `docker-compose.mssql.yml` with SQL Server 2022 + Caddy HTTPS proxy + OTLP collector.
- **Not the default yet:** Available as `npm run dev:mssql` — promoted to default only after proven stable.
- **Two modes:** Prod-like (NODE_ENV=production) for HTTPS/security/logging tests vs dev-mode (NODE_ENV=development via compose profile) for cold-start simulation. Delay middleware is disabled in production.
- **Per-test log capture:** Playwright fixture captures `docker compose logs --since <timestamp>` per test, attaches to HTML report, flags ERROR/FATAL. ~50-100ms overhead per test.
- **OTel trace verification:** OTLP collector container (~50MB) receives spans via OTLP HTTP exporter fallback in `server/telemetry.js`. Present locally; planned for staging CI (Phase 6). Skipped in PR CI. Production uses real Azure Monitor.
- **OTLP exporter fallback:** `server/telemetry.js` gains a ~10 line conditional: when `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` is set and `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING` is absent, use `@opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-http`. Production path (Azure Monitor) is unaffected.
- **No secure-cookie tests:** Auth uses localStorage + Authorization headers, not cookies.
- **Cold start toggle:** Compose profiles, not hot-reload. Stop and restart with different profile.
- **CI model (planned — Phase 6):** Staging deploy will run MSSQL + OTLP as service containers on every deploy (CS25-6b), pulling directly from MCR (CS25-6a skipped — MCR has no rate limits). This will be the primary CI validation path. Separate MSSQL E2E workflow is optional for deeper testing (cold start, Caddy HTTPS). PR CI skips MSSQL/OTel (unit tests sufficient).
- **Version pinning:** MSSQL image pinned to specific CU tag (not `:latest`). OTel packages pinned to compatible versions and updated together. Docker Compose v2 minimum requirement verified in scripts.
- **Log capture monitoring:** Total per-test log capture overhead measured and reported. Warn at >60s, alert/fail at >120s to catch regressions early.
