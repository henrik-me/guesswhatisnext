# Guess What's Next

🎮 **Live at [gwn.metzger.dk](https://gwn.metzger.dk)**

A browser-based puzzle game where you're shown a sequence of items — emoji, text, or images — that follow a pattern, and you must guess what comes next!

Features single-player (free play + daily challenge), global leaderboards, and real-time multiplayer (2–10 players).

## How to Play

### Single Player
1. Choose a game mode from the home screen:
   - **🎮 Free Play** — Pick a category (or random) and complete 10 rounds
   - **📅 Daily Challenge** — One puzzle per day, same for everyone. Share your result Wordle-style!
2. You'll see a sequence of items. Study the pattern.
3. Pick the correct next item from 4 choices.
4. Answer quickly — faster answers earn more points!
5. Use keyboard shortcuts **1–4** to select options.

### Multiplayer
1. Click **⚔️ Multiplayer** and log in (or register)
2. **Create Room** — get a room code to share with friends (2–10 players)
3. **Join Room** — enter a friend's room code
4. As host: configure max players and rounds, click **Start Game** when ready
5. All players answer the same puzzles simultaneously
6. After the match: view full rankings, request a rematch, or check match history

> **Note:** The host (room creator) controls when the game starts. Non-hosts see a "Waiting for host" message.

### Scoring

| Component | Points |
|---|---|
| Correct answer | 100 base points |
| Speed bonus | Up to +100 (faster = more) |
| Streak x1.5 | 3–5 correct in a row (single player) |
| Streak x2.0 | 6+ correct in a row (single player) |
| Wrong answer | 0 points, streak resets |

## Developer Guide

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v20+
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (optional, for container-based dev)

### Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/henrik-me/guesswhatisnext.git
cd guesswhatisnext

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the server
npm start
# → http://localhost:3000
```

For development with auto-reload:
```bash
npm run dev
```

For production-like local testing (HTTPS + log capture):
```bash
npm run dev:full
# → https://localhost:3443 (accept self-signed cert warning)
```

### Admin Bootstrapping

The first admin user must be bootstrapped. Two options:

1. **Environment variable (recommended):** Set both `SYSTEM_API_KEY` (to a non-default value) and `ADMIN_USERNAME` to auto-promote a registered user to admin on server startup:
   ```bash
   SYSTEM_API_KEY=my-secret-key ADMIN_USERNAME=myuser npm start
   ```
2. **API key:** Use the system API key to promote a user via the admin API:
   ```bash
   # Find the user's ID
   curl -H "X-API-Key: $SYSTEM_API_KEY" http://localhost:3000/api/users

   # Promote to admin
   curl -X PUT -H "X-API-Key: $SYSTEM_API_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"role":"admin"}' http://localhost:3000/api/users/<USER_ID>/role
   ```

Once promoted, admin users can manage other users' roles from the **🛡️ Moderation** screen in the UI. Note: after a role change, the user must log out and log back in for the new role to take effect (the role is stored in their JWT token).

### Feature Flags

This section documents the small central **server-side feature-flag system** introduced in PR #91, which safely ships incomplete or limited-access features without exposing them to everyone at once.

- **Evaluation order:** start from the feature's configured default state; then apply a feature-specific request override only when that feature allows overrides in the current environment; otherwise apply explicit user targeting, then deterministic percentage rollout. If none of those change the result, the feature remains at its default state.
- **Supported controls:** feature default state, specific-user targeting, deterministic percentage rollout, and optional query-param/header overrides for features that explicitly opt in. Targeting and percentage rollout may enable a feature even when its default state is off.
- **Client/server model:** in branches that include PR #91, the client reads `/api/features` to hide or show gated UI, but server routes must still enforce the same flag

**`submitPuzzle` feature-flag setup on PR #91**
- Canonical feature-flag key: `submitPuzzle`
- Hidden/disabled by default
- Can be enabled for specific users and/or a rollout percentage
- Request overrides are allowed for this feature only outside `production` and `staging`
- Override identifiers for `submitPuzzle`: query param `ff_submit_puzzle`, header `x-gwn-feature-submit-puzzle`

> Overrides are feature-specific and opt-in, not a global bypass. Only use them for features that explicitly define override support.
>
> `submitPuzzle` is the feature-flag key. The override names above are request identifiers, not alternate flag keys or UI route names.
>
> If your branch does not include PR #91 yet, `/api/features` and the documented `submitPuzzle` overrides will not be available there.

### Running with Docker

**SQLite (default, local dev):**
```bash
docker compose up --build
# → http://localhost:3000
```

**MSSQL (production-like validation):**

Runs the full stack against SQL Server 2022 with HTTPS via Caddy reverse proxy, OTLP trace collector, and per-test log capture — mirrors the production Azure SQL environment:
```bash
# Start MSSQL + app + HTTPS proxy + OTLP collector
npm run dev:mssql
# → https://localhost (accept self-signed cert warning once)

# Run E2E tests against the MSSQL stack (waits for health, runs Playwright)
npm run test:e2e:mssql

# Enable cold start simulation (delay overlay)
npm run dev:mssql:coldstart

# View pretty-printed live logs
npm run docker:mssql:logs

# Errors only
docker compose -f docker-compose.mssql.yml logs app --no-log-prefix | npx pino-pretty -L error

# Export raw JSON logs for analysis
docker compose -f docker-compose.mssql.yml logs app --no-log-prefix > app-logs.json

# Stop everything
npm run dev:mssql:down
```

The MSSQL stack includes:
- **SQL Server 2022** (CU17, pinned to specific image tag for reproducibility)
- **Caddy HTTPS proxy** with auto-generated TLS certificates
- **OTLP collector** (`otel/opentelemetry-collector:0.100.0`) for local trace verification
- **Per-test log capture** — server logs attached to Playwright HTML report with ERROR/FATAL flagging

> **Note:** First-time MSSQL image pull is ~1.5GB — allow several minutes on slow connections. Requires Docker Compose v2+ (verified automatically).

The Docker MSSQL stack produces **production-identical structured JSON logs** (Pino) — every HTTP request, WebSocket event, migration, auth event, and error is captured with the same schema as production.

**CI integration (planned):** Staging deploys will validate against MSSQL using images pulled directly from MCR (mcr.microsoft.com) as service containers — no GHCR mirror needed since MCR has no rate limits.

### Testing

```bash
# Run unit + integration tests (vitest)
npm test

# Run E2E browser tests (Playwright)
npm run test:e2e

# Run everything (vitest + Playwright)
npm run test:all

# Watch mode (re-run on changes)
npm run test:watch

# With coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Lint
npm run lint
```

Tests are fully isolated — each suite gets its own temp database and random port. Safe to run in parallel across worktrees.

### Known Issues

- On Node >= 22.13, `npm ci` may install the optional `artillery` load-testing dependency and emit OpenTelemetry peer-dependency warnings. Those warnings come from optional load-testing dependencies that still pull older OTel metrics/exporter packages, while the application's runtime telemetry path uses newer OTel packages.
- This is currently treated as non-blocking install noise for optional load-testing tooling. It does not affect the validated runtime telemetry path, and no dependency changes are planned right now. If you do not need load testing, `npm ci --omit=optional` avoids the warning by skipping optional dependencies such as `artillery`.

### Parallel Development (Worktrees)

For parallel work, the project uses **fixed git worktree slots** with task-specific branches:

```bash
# Worktrees live in C:\src\gwn-worktrees\wt-1 through wt-4
git worktree list    # see which branch is in which slot
```

Each worktree agent pushes its branch and creates a PR. The orchestrating agent merges approved PRs. See [INSTRUCTIONS.md](INSTRUCTIONS.md) for full workflow details.

**Current workflow:** Push branch → create PR → Copilot review → squash-merge to main.

  DB backend auto-selects:
    DATABASE_URL set → Azure SQL / MSSQL (production)
    DATABASE_URL absent → SQLite (local dev, tests)

  Routes use `?` placeholders. The adapter layer handles:
    SQLite: pass-through
    MSSQL:  ? → @p1, LIMIT → OFFSET/FETCH, dates, RANDOM, etc.

> **Note:** Push to `main` does **not** deploy by default. Deployment runs when triggered
> manually via `workflow_dispatch`, or automatically on push when `STAGING_AUTO_DEPLOY` is enabled.
> All code reaches production through the staging pipeline: staging validation → manual prod deploy.

| Environment | Cost | Trigger | Approval | Rollback |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Local (SQLite) | Free | `npm start` / `docker compose up` | None | N/A |
| Local (MSSQL) | Free | `npm run dev:mssql` | None | N/A |
| Local (MSSQL cold start) | Free | `npm run dev:mssql:coldstart` | None | N/A |
| Ephemeral staging | $0 (GitHub Actions) | Manual `workflow_dispatch`, or `push` to `main` when `STAGING_AUTO_DEPLOY` is enabled | Automatic | N/A (ephemeral) |
| Azure staging | $0 (scale-to-zero) | After ephemeral validation | Manual | Redeploy previous SHA tag |
| Production | $0+ (pay-per-use, Azure SQL) | Manual trigger (staging must be green) | Manual | Auto-rollback to previous SHA tag |

### Useful Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `npm start` | Start the server on port 3000 |
| `npm run dev` | Start with auto-reload (--watch) |
| `npm run dev:full` | HTTPS + log capture (recommended for testing) |
| `npm run dev:log` | HTTP + log capture (plain HTTP with logging) |
| `npm run dev:mssql` | Start MSSQL stack (SQL Server + app + HTTPS + OTLP) |
| `npm run dev:mssql:coldstart` | MSSQL stack with cold start delay simulation |
| `npm run dev:mssql:down` | Stop MSSQL Docker stack and remove containers |
| `npm test` | Run unit + integration tests (vitest) |
| `npm run test:e2e` | Run E2E browser tests (Playwright) |
| `npm run test:e2e:mssql` | Run E2E tests against MSSQL stack (health wait + Playwright) |
| `npm run test:mssql` | Run tests against local MSSQL container |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint (0 warnings target) |
| `npm run docker:mssql` | Start full MSSQL stack (alias, prefer `dev:mssql`) |
| `npm run docker:mssql:logs` | Pretty-printed live log tail from MSSQL stack |
| `npm run docker:mssql:down` | Stop MSSQL Docker stack |

### Development Server Modes

| Mode | Command | URL | Use Case |
|---|---|---|---|
| Quick iteration | `npm run dev` | http://localhost:3000 | Code changes with auto-reload |
| Full local testing | `npm run dev:full` | https://localhost:3443 | Production-like: HTTPS, security headers, log capture |
| HTTP + logging | `npm run dev:log` | http://localhost:3000 | Log analysis without HTTPS overhead |

**`dev:full` (recommended for manual testing)** starts an HTTPS server with self-signed certificates, security headers active (including CSP, HSTS, and Permissions-Policy), and captures structured logs to `telemetry.log`. An HTTP server on port 3080 redirects to HTTPS, verifying the redirect middleware.

All modes except `dev` capture logs to `telemetry.log` by default. Use `--no-log-file` to disable:
```bash
node scripts/dev-server.js --no-log-file
```

### Testing Cold Start UX

The delay simulation middleware lets you test how the app handles Azure SQL cold starts locally.

**Using the MSSQL cold start overlay (recommended):**
```bash
# Start MSSQL stack with delay middleware enabled
npm run dev:mssql:coldstart

# Default pattern: 45s → 16s → 0s ×4 → repeat
# Custom pattern:
GWN_DB_DELAY_PATTERN=45000,30000,0,0 npm run dev:mssql:coldstart

# Tear down (same as normal MSSQL stack)
npm run dev:mssql:down
```

The `dev:mssql:coldstart` script uses `docker-compose.mssql.delay.yml` as a compose overlay that switches to `NODE_ENV=development` (enabling the delay middleware) while keeping the full MSSQL + Caddy HTTPS + OTLP stack.

**Using the SQLite stack with delays:**

**Fixed delay (all API calls delayed equally):**
```bash
GWN_DB_DELAY_MS=20000 docker compose up
```

**Cycling pattern (simulates cold start → warm-up → warm → restart):**
```bash
GWN_DB_DELAY_PATTERN=45000,15000,0,0,0,0 docker compose up
```

The pattern advances when there's a gap of 2 seconds or more between requests (i.e., a new page navigation). Parallel API calls within the same page load all get the same delay.

| Navigation | Delay | Simulates |
|------------|-------|-----------|
| 1st page load | 45s | Cold start (retry button appears) |
| 2nd page load | 15s | Warming up (progressive messages) |
| 3rd–6th page loads | 0s | Warm (instant response) |
| 7th page load | 45s | Cold restart (cycle repeats) |

**With Docker Compose port isolation:**
```bash
HOST_PORT=3005 GWN_DB_DELAY_PATTERN=45000,15000,0,0,0,0 docker compose -p gwn-delay-test up -d
# Open http://localhost:3005
```

> **Note:** Delay is disabled in production and staging environments. Health endpoints (`/api/health`, `/healthz`) are never delayed.
